## Method

![method](assets/method.png)

We design an Enhance Block as a parallel branch. This branch computes the average of non-diagonal elements of temporal attention maps as cross-frame intensity (CFI). An enhanced temperature parameter multiplies the CFI to enhance the temporal attention output.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n enhanceAvideo python=3.10
conda activate enhanceAvideo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate videos:

```bash
python cogvideox.py
